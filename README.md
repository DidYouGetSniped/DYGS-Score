Welcome to the DYGS Score calculator for War Brokers! This program allows you to calculate a custom player score based on your in-game stats. Without ELO Inflation!

What is the DYGS Score?
-----------------------

The **DYGS Score** is a proprietary metric developed by [DidYouGetSniped](https://github.com/DidYouGetSniped) to evaluate a War Brokers player's skill level and experience. It takes into account three key factors:

*   **Level** - Rewards player progression and time invested in the game. Higher levels have a greater impact on your score.
*   **K/D Ratio** - Measures your kill-death proficiency. Higher K/D means better performance.
*   **ELO** - Represents your competitive ranking ability. Higher ELO improves your score.

Your DYGS Score is calculated by a weighted formula using these three stats. The end result is a comprehensive skill score tailored for War Brokers.
