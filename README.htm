<h1>DYGS Score Calculator</h1>

<p>Welcome to the DYGS Score calculator for War Brokers! This program allows you to calculate a custom player score based on your in-game stats.</p>

<h2>What is the DYGS Score?</h2>

<p>The <b>DYGS Score</b> is a proprietary metric developed by <a href="https://github.com/DidYouGetSniped">DidYouGetSniped</a> to evaluate a War Brokers player's skill level and experience. It takes into account three key factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Level</b> - Rewards player progression and time invested in the game. Higher levels have a greater impact on your score.</li>
  <li><b>K/D Ratio</b> - Measures your kill-death proficiency. Higher K/D means better performance.</li>
  <li><b>ELO</b> - Represents your competitive ranking ability. Higher ELO improves your score.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Your DYGS Score is calculated by a weighted formula using these three stats. The end result is a comprehensive skill score tailored for War Brokers.</p>
